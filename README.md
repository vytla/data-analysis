# Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

### Overview 
The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

Data comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there 'right away' or 'later before the coupon expires' are labeled as 'Y = 1' and answers 'no, I do not want the coupon' are labeled as 'Y = 0'. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).

Following are the observations from Data Analysis.
